# msufsort.4.2
temp holding place for next round of msufsort
Don't hold me accountable for any crud that you might find in this branch - its a scratch pad for experimental ideas
that will EVENTUALLY be the next gen MSufsort

this is a work in progress and is far from complete.

New features:
    opportunistic induced sorting
    work contract based multithreading

Current state:
    support multithreaded SuffixArray construction for first half of ITS
    (the app can sort all B* suffixes but lacks the second stage of the improved two stage at this point)
